      <p>
        ETMUN is a prestigious Model United Nations conference held annually at

        countries, immersing themselves in the world of international diplomacy
        and negotiation. Through committee sessions, resolution drafting, and
        collaborative problem-solving, students gain invaluable insights into

      <h2>What is Model United Nations?</h2>
      <p>
        Model United Nations, also known as Model UN or MUN, is an educational
        simulation and academic competition in which students learn about
        diplomacy, international relations, and the United Nations. MUN involves
        and teaches participants speaking, debating, and writing skills, in
        addition to critical thinking, teamwork, and leadership abilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Model UN, students step into the shoes of ambassadors from UN member
        states to debate current issues on the organization's agenda. While
        playing their roles as ambassadors, student "delegates" make speeches,
        prepare draft resolutions, negotiate with allies and adversaries,
        resolve conflicts, and navigate the conference rules of procedure—all in
        the interest of mobilizing international cooperation to resolve problems
        that affect countries all over the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Model UN conferences are usually held at a university or college campus.
        At the end of a conference, outstanding delegates in each committee are
        recognized and given an award certificate; the Best Delegate in each
        committee receives a gavel.
