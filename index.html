      <h2>What is Model United Nations?</h2>
      <p>
        Model United Nations, also known as Model UN or MUN, is an educational
        simulation and academic competition in which students can learn about
        diplomacy, international relations, and the United Nations. MUN involves
        and teaches participants speaking, debating, and writing skills, in
        addition to critical thinking, teamwork, and leadership abilities. Model
        United Nations conferences are usually held at a university or college
        campus. At the end of a conference, outstanding delegates in each
        committee are recognized and given an award certificate; the Best
        Delegate in each committee, however, receives a gavel.
