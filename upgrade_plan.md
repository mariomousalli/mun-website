# ETMUN Website Upgrade Plan

## Current Website Analysis

After analyzing the current ETMUN (English Talents Model United Nations) website, I've identified the following issues and improvement opportunities:

### Structure Issues:
1. Most pages (about.html, comitties.html, contact.html) are incomplete and missing content sections
2. Inconsistent spelling of "committees" (appears as both "comitties" and "committies")
3. Navigation includes a link to register.html which doesn't exist
4. The script.js file exists but is empty
5. No images or visual elements beyond basic styling
6. No favicon for browser tabs

### Design Issues:
1. Basic design with limited visual appeal
2. No logo or branding elements
3. Limited responsiveness for mobile devices
4. No animations or interactive elements
5. Content layout is simple and could be more engaging

### Functionality Issues:
1. No registration functionality despite having a register link
2. No contact form on the contact page
3. No interactive elements or dynamic content
4. No social media integration
5. No search functionality
